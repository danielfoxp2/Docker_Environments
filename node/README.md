#Description

Here you will find a Dockerfile and some directories related.

##The Dockerfile

The Dockerfile is about to build and run node.js 4 and npm.

So if you want just node.js and nothing more, this is the Dockerfile to build and run.

#The directories

The folders within this directory are specialization of the node image.

So, if you want to run JasmineJS, you build the node image and build the Dockerfile inside 
jasmine-node directory. Same if you want Cucumber or SailsJS.

Soon code examples will be placed here
